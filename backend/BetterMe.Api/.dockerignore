🔭 Future Enhancements

Here are some ideas for what you might build next:

Role-based features (e.g., admin vs standard user, task assignments).

Notification system (email / push) for due tasks.

Real-time updates (SignalR, WebSockets).

Mobile client (e.g., using Flutter, React Native).

Improved UI/UX design, dark mode toggle.

Analytics dashboard: tasks completed, productivity metrics.

Multi-tenant support or team collaboration features.

🏥 eHospital — Development Plan
💡 Overall Goal

A Full-Stack Hospital Management System with:

.NET 8 Web API backend (admin + data)

SQL Server database

Angular frontend (admin dashboard)

Flutter mobile app (patient/client app, later)

Clean architecture + best practices (Entity Framework, DTOs, JWT Auth, Role-based access)

🧩 Phase 1 — Project Foundation (you’ve done 80%)

✅ Set up:

Solution and projects (Api, Application, Infrastructure, Domain)

References and NuGet packages

GitHub repo and first commit

🟢 Next:

Add appsettings.json connection string

Create initial database with EF Core

Build entity models

🧠 Phase 2 — Database & Domain Design
Tables / Entities

We’ll design core hospital modules first:

Module	Entities	Description
👩‍⚕️ User Management	User, Role, Doctor, Patient, Admin	Authentication + roles
📋 Appointments	Appointment, DoctorSchedule	Booking and time management
💊 Pharmacy	Medication, Prescription	Manage and assign medicines
🏥 Departments	Department	Each doctor belongs to one
📑 Medical Records	MedicalRecord, Diagnosis, Report	History of patient visits
💵 Billing (optional later)	Invoice, Payment	Track payments
💬 Chat (Bonus phase)	Chat, Message, Attachment, etc.	Real-time messaging (later)
⚙️ Phase 3 — Backend Features (API)

We’ll create these API modules in order:

Step	Module	Endpoints (examples)
1️⃣	Auth & Users	/api/auth/register, /api/auth/login, /api/users
2️⃣	Doctors & Patients	CRUD: /api/doctors, /api/patients
3️⃣	Departments	CRUD: /api/departments
4️⃣	Appointments	/api/appointments, /api/appointments/book
5️⃣	Medications & Prescriptions	/api/medications, /api/prescriptions
6️⃣	Medical Records	/api/records, /api/reports
7️⃣	Dashboard Reporting (admin)	/api/dashboard (counts, stats, charts)
8️⃣	File upload (images, reports)	/api/files/upload
9️⃣	Chat (bonus)	/hubs/chat via SignalR

Each module will follow clean structure:

EHosp.Api/
  Controllers/
EHosp.Application/
  Services/
EHosp.Domain/
  Entities/
EHosp.Infrastructure/
  Repositories/

💾 Phase 4 — Database Setup

Create AppDbContext with all DbSet<>

Configure relationships and seed data (departments, roles)

Run migrations:

dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate -p EHosp.Infrastructure -s EHosp.Api
dotnet ef database update -p EHosp.Infrastructure -s EHosp.Api

🔑 Phase 5 — Authentication & Authorization

Implement JWT Auth (login/register)

Add roles: Admin, Doctor, Patient

Secure endpoints with [Authorize(Roles = "Admin")] etc.

Return tokens with user info and role.

🧭 Phase 6 — Angular Frontend

After backend basics are ready:

Create Angular routes:

/login
/dashboard
/patients
/doctors
/appointments
/medications
/departments
/reports


Services for API calls

Components for CRUD and lists

Authentication guard (JWT token in localStorage)

📱 Phase 7 — Flutter Mobile App (later)

Patient app for appointment booking, prescriptions, messages

Connect to same API

💬 Phase 8 — Bonus Chat & Realtime

Add SignalR

Add chat tables and endpoints

Implement WebSocket-based real-time messaging

📊 Phase 9 — Reporting & Analytics (optional)

Admin dashboard with:

Total patients, doctors, appointments, revenue

Charts (appointments per day, top doctors, etc.)

Export to Excel/PDF

📦 Phase 10 — Deployment

Dockerize backend and frontend

Deploy to Railway or Render (free tier)

Add CI/CD workflow (GitHub Actions)
