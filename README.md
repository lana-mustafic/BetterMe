## Project Overview

BetterMe is a robust, full-stack web application designed to manage tasks (a To-Do app) built using modern technologies: a backend API with **.NET 8** and a frontend SPA with **Angular 20**.  
It emphasizes best practices: JWT-based authentication, role-based access, task CRUD, filters, and containerized deployment with Docker.

This project is ideal for:
- Demonstrating proficiency in backend + frontend full-stack development.  
- Showcasing secure authentication and authorization workflows.  
- Practicing deployment workflows (Docker, CI/CD).  
- Serving as a foundation for larger productivity or business applications.  

---

## Key Features

- **Authentication & Authorization** â€“ Users can register and login; secure endpoints via JWT tokens and role-based authorization.  
- **Task Management (CRUD)** â€“ Create, Read, Update, Delete tasks; tasks can be assigned, filtered, sorted, and marked complete.  
- **Persistent Data Layer** â€“ Built on SQL Server (or compatible) via Entity Framework Core for schema, migrations, and data access.  
- **Modern Frontend SPA** â€“ Responsive UI built with Angular 20, communicates with backend API, handles user sessions, task views.  
- **Deployment Ready** â€“ Dockerfile(s) + docker-compose setup allow you to containerize both backend and frontend (and database) for easy deployment.  
- **Clean Architecture / Folder Structure** â€“ Logical separation of concerns: backend and frontend folders, config, and settings neatly organized.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- .NET 8 SDK installed on your development machine.  
- Node.js (LTS) + Angular CLI installed.  
- SQL Server (or compatible) installed and accessible (LocalDB or other).  
- Docker Desktop (optional but recommended for containerized setup).  

---

### Local Setup

#### 1. Backend API Setup
```bash
cd backend/BetterMe.Api
# Configure connection string in appsettings.json to point at your SQL Server instance
dotnet restore
dotnet ef database update    # Applies any migrations, creates schema
dotnet run                   # Runs the API (typically at http://localhost:5000 or similar)
```

### 2. Frontend Application Setup
```bash
cd frontend/betterme
npm install
ng serve                     # Launches the Angular app (typically at http://localhost:4200)
```

### 3. Dockerized Deployment

From the root of the repo:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
## Usage

- Navigate to the frontend URL (e.g., http://localhost:4200).  
- Register a new user or login.  
- Create, view, edit, and delete tasks.  
- Filter or sort tasks by status, due date.  
- Explore the API endpoints (e.g., via Swagger or Postman).
